# My Journey Of 2022 🎊 Dev Retro 2022 🎉✨

### 👋 **Introduction**

***Hi My Friends***, 👋! this a Challenge in which we have to tell our journey and how we started all of this I'm a **5th-year** Semester **BSCS** student with no idea about programming, I used to go to school and watch friends👀 doing great in other fields, like sports, study etc. thinking about how can I start my programming journey to guide you. This year went well.

First time I got a chance to reflect on my journey through this `#DevRetro2022` challenge and I am so grateful for this I am writing this while I m excited, to share with you where I started my journey as a **developer**. And How was my journey, all I am going to share here, so be with me this is going be a roller coaster of my journey of 2022💥🎊

### 1.👨‍💻 Web Development journey

After the Matric examination, we got 1 month's holiday. So, I decided to learn **Web development** 👨‍💻 for that I took an **Aptech** course from a nearby branch from where I became a certified web developer in which I love coding also my friend is already learning. In the first week, I learn basic **HTML** and build a personal website. Within 2-3 months I learned **CSS** and **JavaScript**. After that, After passing out I thought myself some frameworks and libraries such as `Bootstrap, React JS, Node JS, Next JS & Express JS` from **Youtube** or **Online Stuff**. After that. Currently, I am learning more about new frameworks in React JS.

I have made some projects while learning web development you can see them all on my [Github account](https://github.com/HamzaZaidiX/).

### 2\. 🚀 Contribution's to Hacktoberfest and open source

Again I know about Hacktoberfest and open source from HamzaZaidi.

In October, I participated in Hacktberfest 🚀. At the beginning of October

I struggled a lot to find open-source projects then I search on google how to find open-source projects and some tips to search organizations on GitHub. Through the help of youtube videos, I found a few organizations for web development. At that time I did not learn about backend development, So I contributed😊 as a **frontend developer🖤.**

From Hacktoberfest I learn a few things:

*   How to find an open-source project.
    
*   Get involved in communities.
    
*   Learn how to read large code bases.
    
*   How to network with people.
    
*   Build Coding Projects by yourself
    

### 3\. 💁‍♂️ Community support and Linkedin

In my university period, there are no such communities and groups which help students to grow as developers. In starting I used to take guidance from my relatives & seniors that person's technical background. Later I involve in some communities and learn how to network with people, for same **Linkedin** help me to connect 🔗 with people and also make me find my career through a job and education.

You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shjz).

### 4\. 📝 Started a blog

> ***Sharing knowledge is vital for our species. It gives us self-esteem and eventually will bring peace.***

In November, I decided to share my learning with others. So, I know a way of sharing knowledge is through *blogs*.

I start writing a blog with Hash node. Here is [my first blog](https://shjz.hashnode.dev/portfolio-app-by-react-bricks) 📝.

In the future, I'll be sharing my learning and some content on my [Profile](https://shjz.hashnode.dev/) Please Like, Share and Follow me!

It would be nice if you tell me **how was your this year?** Let us know in the **Comments** below! 👇
