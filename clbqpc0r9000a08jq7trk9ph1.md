## 4\. Es Lint

Integrates [**ESLint**](http://eslint.org/) into VS Code. If you are new to ESLint check the [**documentation**](http://eslint.org/).

The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn’t provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven’t installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running `npm install eslint` in the workspace folder for a local install or `npm install -g eslint` for a global install.

On new folders, you might also need to create a `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can do this by either using the VS Code command `Create ESLint configuration` or by running the `eslint` command in a terminal. If you have installed ESLint globally (see above) then run `[eslint --init`\]([**eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-int**](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-int)[**..**](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface)) in a terminal. If you have installed ESLint locally then run `[.\node_modules\.bin\eslint --init`\]([**eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-int**](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-int)[**..**](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface)) under Windows and `[./node_modules/.bin/eslint --init`\]([**eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-int**](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-int)[**..**](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface)) under Linux and Mac.

The Bracket Pair Colorizer extension is one of the most productive Visual Studio Code extensions for frequent programmers. If you are like me and often find yourself falsely navigating through those confusing curly brackets when inspecting branches of code; this one is a must-have for you. It allows the editor to identify matching brackets with colours you can define and configure. So, it enables you to know the depth of a code branch by merely having a look at the respective bracket’s colour.
