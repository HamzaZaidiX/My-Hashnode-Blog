# A Dinosaur found in PakistanðŸ¦•ðŸ˜¯

**Balochisaurus** ðŸ¦• is a genus of sauropod dinosaurs that lived during the Late **Cretaceous** period, around 70-66 million years ago. It is known from fragmentary remains that have been found in mainly **Pakistan** and **Uzbekistan**.

The type species of Balochisaurus, B. kirthari, was named in **1995** based on a partial skeleton that was discovered in Pakistan. The remains included a few vertebrae, a rib, and part of the shoulder girdle.

Based on the size and shape of these bones, paleontologists believe that Balochisaurus was a medium-sized sauropod, similar in size to Diplodocus. However, much is still unknown about the anatomy and biology of this dinosaur, as the remains are relatively incomplete.

Despite the limited information available about Balochisaurus, it is clear that this dinosaur played an important role in the ecosystems of the Late Cretaceous. As a herbivorous sauropod, Balochisaurus likely played a key role in the food web, serving as a primary source of food for larger predators.

More research is needed to learn more about the biology and evolution of Balochisaurus. Continued paleontological discoveries in Pakistan and Uzbekistan may help to fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge about this fascinating dinosaur.

**Name:** *Balochisaurus* â€­(â€¬Balochi lizardâ€­)â€¬.  
**Phonetic:** â€­Bâ€¬al-och-e-sore-us.  
**Named By:** M.â€­ â€¬Sadiq Malkaniâ€­ â€¬-â€­ â€¬2006.  
**Classification:** Chordata,â€­ â€¬Reptilia,â€­ â€¬Dinosauria,â€­ â€¬Saurischia,â€­ â€¬Sauropodomorpha,â€­ â€¬Sauropoda,â€­ â€¬Titanosauria,â€­ â€¬Balochisauridaeâ€­  
**Species:** *B.â€­ â€¬malkaniâ€­*â€¬.  
**Diet:** Herbivore.  
**Size:** 3 meters (10 feet) long Neck and tall feet.  
**Known locations:** Pakistan,â€­ â€¬Balochistanâ€­ â€¬-â€­ â€¬Pab Formation.  
**Period:** Maastrichtian of the Cretaceous.  
**Fossil representation:** 7â€­ â€¬caudal vertebrae.â€­ â€¬Partial skull material has since been attributed to it.

**Family:** [Pakisauridae](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALiCzsZeOufMpN2PiAgOTNSsYaG6-8O0jg:1671302969004&q=Pakisauridae&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LSz9U3MCq3zDLLVuLVT9c3NEw2Li4yz8gz07LMTrbST8rMz8lPr9TPL0pPzMsszo1PzkksLs5My0xOLMnMz7PKyEzPSC1SQBVdxMoTkJidWZxYWpSZkpi6g5VxFzsTBwMAVQs9x28AAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwje853eqIH8AhWIQaQEHdWrBFIQmxMoAXoECEsQAw&biw=1366&bih=625&dpr=1)

Inâ€­ â€¬2006â€­ â€¬paleontologist M.â€­ â€¬Sadiq Malkani managed to name five titanosaurs from the Pab Formation of Pakistan,â€­ â€¬all described from caudalâ€­ (â€¬tailâ€­) â€¬vertebrae.â€­ â€¬Malkani also named two new families of titanosaurs,â€­ â€¬the Pakisauridae and the Balochisauridae as homes for the new titanosaurs.â€­ *â€¬Balochisaurus* as you may have guessed is the type genus of the Balochisauridae,â€­ â€¬which also includes [*Marisaurus*](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/m/marisaurus.html).â€­ â€¬It is questionable if either the Balochisauridae and the Pakisauridae and their member genera will survive future classification given how these titanosaurs were named,â€­ â€¬though itâ€™s not impossible either that they might be proven valid with future finds.  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The other titanosaurs named by Malkani inâ€­ â€¬2006â€­ â€¬are [*Pakisaurus*](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/p/pakisaurus.html),â€­ â€¬[*Sulaimanisaurus*](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/s/sulaimanisaurus.html) and [*Khetranisaurus*](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/k/khetranisaurus.html),â€­ â€¬all assigned to the [Pakisauridae](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALiCzsZeOufMpN2PiAgOTNSsYaG6-8O0jg:1671302969004&q=Pakisauridae&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LSz9U3MCq3zDLLVuLVT9c3NEw2Li4yz8gz07LMTrbST8rMz8lPr9TPL0pPzMsszo1PzkksLs5My0xOLMnMz7PKyEzPSC1SQBVdxMoTkJidWZxYWpSZkpi6g5VxFzsTBwMAVQs9x28AAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwje853eqIH8AhWIQaQEHdWrBFIQmxMoAXoECEsQAw&biw=1366&bih=625&dpr=1).â€­ â€¬Also inâ€­ â€¬2006,â€­ â€¬Malkani named an abelisaurid theropod named [*Vitakridrinda*](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/v/vitakridrinda.html).

#### ðŸ˜¯ Other Interesting Facts:

Based on the available fossil evidence, Balochisaurus was a small dinosaur, with an estimated length of about 3 meters (10 feet). It had a long neck and a small head, and it is thought to have had a beak-like structure on its jaw.

Unlike many other herbivorous dinosaurs, Balochisaurus did not have any teeth. Instead, it is thought to have used its beak to tear off and crush vegetation. It may have been a specialized browser, feeding on soft, leafy plants rather than tougher, woody ones.

Despite its small size, Balochisaurus was likely a successful dinosaur, as it was able to adapt to a variety of ecological niches and survive for millions of years. Its discovery has also helped paleontologists better understand the diversity of dinosaurs that lived in the Late Cretaceous period in what is now Pakistan.

Overall, Balochisaurus is an interesting and little-known dinosaur that adds to our understanding of the diversity and evolution of dinosaurs during the Late Cretaceous period.
